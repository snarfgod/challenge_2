# Loan Qualifier Application

--- This is an application that will allow the user to input credit score, monthly debt, monthly income, collateral value, and desired loan amount to check against a list of loans to find all qualifying loans. The `csv` file it will search against must be provided by the user. In future updates, it will then save the data to a csv in a file of the user's choice. 

## Technologies

--- This project uses python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire) - For the command line interface, help page, and entrypoint.

* [questionary](https://github.com/tmbo/questionary) - For interactive user prompts and dialogs

## Installation Guide

--- To install fire: `pip install fire`
--- To install questionary: `pip install questionary`
